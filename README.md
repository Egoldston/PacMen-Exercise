# PacMen
## Description:
In this project, the user can create one or many Pacman images that move across the page. There are two buttons, one that adds more Pacmen and one to start the animation. They will move in random directions and velocities and then bounce off the border of the page. This exemplifies DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation.

## How to Run:
Copy or fork the repository to your computer then open the "index.html" file in a browser. The screen should have an "Add PacMan" and a "Start Game" button. 

## Roadmap for future improvements:
I could update the Pacmen to change color and/or size when they hit the border and maybe add a "Stop" button.
